### Hi there!
My name is Joshua Otterman. I'm a game developer who enjoys working with both Unity and Unreal Engine 4.

Professionally, I've been working with Unity for since 2021, and I've had the opportunity to work on projects that have both challenged me and given me a passion and excitement for game development as well as an eagerness to learn new skills.

Most of my personal repos are currently set to private while I work on them outside my day-job, but I will start making them public as I build them out into something I want to show. So check back here from time to time to see what I've been working on.

For now, feel free to check out my public repositories.
