### Hi there!
My name is Joshua Otterman. I'm a game developer who enjoys working with both Unity and Unreal Engine 4. Right now my focus is on learning Unity as I work on developing various game projects to push myself to gain a greater understanding of the Unity engine and its capabilities.

Feel free to check out my repositories to see what I've been working on.
